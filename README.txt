IbOleDb is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  This license 
provides you with specific rights and restrictions.  One point I want to clarify about my 
understanding of the LGPL is your obligations when releasing larger works that include 
IbOleDb.

1) If your larger work (product) is only used within your company or organization, then you 
   have no obligation to do anything further.

2) If your product is distributed to the general public, be it free, or not, then things
   get a little more involved, but are not too bad.  Here is all that is required:

     a) Give notice that your product includes IbOleDb and that IbOleDb is covered by the 
        LGPL. 

     b) Include a copy of the LGPL in either printed form, or as a file.

     c) Display the IbOleDb copyright notice:
          Copyright (C) 2002, 2001, 2000 Ralph E. Curry

     d) If you are including an official build that was obtained from SourceForge, then you
        are done.

	If you are including your own derived version then you need to make the source
        code available to the user under the same license as it was licensed to you, the 
        LGPL.  Of course, wouldn't you rather just add your changes to the original version
        so everybody can benefit from your work, and you can simplify your obligations?

     Points a), b) and c) should be displayed in a manner consistent with other notices and
     licenses declared in your program's documentation or installation.  The key thing here
     is that if you do either a) or c) above for any part of your product, then you need to
     do it for IbOleDb too.  If you don't do a) or c) for any part of your product then you
     need only conform to b) and d) as far as I am concerned.

To build IbOleDb, you need:
  * Microsoft MDAC SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/data)
  * InterBase Client SDK (http://www.interbase.com or http://www.firebirdsql.com)
  * Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.  It may be possible to port this to other compilers, but
    my original work was done on VC 6.0 (Version 13.00.9466)

The Visual Studio project and workspace files are not part of the archive.  To build IbOleDb
you will need to use the included make file, iboledb.mak in conjunction with the Microsoft
NMAKE.EXE utility.  This make file is generated by VC, and is not very pretty.

There are two configurations, Release and Debug.  Below are some sample command lines for
creating IbOleDb:
  NMAKE /f "IbOleDb.mak" CFG="IbOleDb - Win32 Release"
  NMAKE /f "IbOleDb.mak" CFG="IbOleDb - Win32 Debug"

In addition to extracting the source, you will probably also need to edit the make file to 
reflect the actual location of your interbase installation.  In particular, the locations of
IBASE.H and GDS32_MS.LIB files need to be correctly specified by the CPP_PROJ and 
LINK32_FLAGS for each configuration.
